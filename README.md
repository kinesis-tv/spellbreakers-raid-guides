# `Spellbreakers Raid Guides`

This repository contains the raid guides for the `<Spellbreakers>` guild on Warmane - Icecrown.

# Assumptions

This guide is meant for the `Icecrown` server on Warmane's 3.3.5a Private Server,
meaning, it does not account for any modified values from `Lorderon` where
berserk timers are shortened, boss damage values are buffed etc.

This guide also speaks to 25 Heroic mode of fights and not Normal Mode, or 10 man mode.
Any specific strategy changes for lower-difficult content will be annotated
in boss specific encounters where applicable.
