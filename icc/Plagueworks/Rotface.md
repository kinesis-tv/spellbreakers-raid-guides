# `Rotface`

At the start of the fight we need to position something like this.
Make sure to spread out `/range 12` to be sure for [Vile Gas](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=69240/vile-gas)

Here are the Starting Postions:
![Rotface Starting Postion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0012c3d-ef6d-413b-9d9b-75f050b01bf8)

Throughout the fight the [Ooze Flood](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=69789/ooze-flood) coming out of the walls will change its location. At all times it will cover 1/4 of the room. It will deal massive damage to you quickly aswell as slow your movement speed. Adjust acordingly like so.

During the fight random people will get [Mutated Infection](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=69674/mutated-infection) cast on them.

This needs to be Dispelled by healers ASAP as the debuff does a lot of damage and reduces the amount of healing the target recieves.

Once it is dispelled you will have a small ooze attacking you. This Small Ooze is immune to all taunts
If you have a small ooze attacking you; you need to offset your character from the boss as you will randomly spit a slime pool in the direction you are facing. DO NOT spit this pool into the melee.

Once 2 small oozes have spawned they need to be combined to make a Big Ooze. This can be done several ways. If 1 in melee 1 in range the melee can run out and combine with the range. If there is a DK tank on Oozes the Dk can Death Grip the Small ooze

Like So:
![Merging 2 small ooze](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1319453297576382567/1336772551845609492/Rotface_combine_ooze.webp?ex=67a505f4&is=67a3b474&hm=a5463a24f0ce2209912db0b7f35d2d0550ebb4a0d2f4817f4e8e7f54970e7a57&=&animated=true&width=1248&height=702)

Once the big ooze is formed the other tank will need to taunt and keep it aggroed to them while kiting it around the room. Tanks DO NOT let it touch you. You may have to kite it through slime pools which will slow your movement. If you are a Paladin use Hand of Freedom to remove the stacks and gain mobility again. Dks can Anti Magic Shield it (AMS). Any other tanks you will need to call for Hand of Freedoms from either the Paladin tank if there is one or from the rets.

After the Big ooze is formed DO NOT bring small oozes to it. Combine small ooze with small ooze and BIG with BIG. Like so
![Merging Big to Big](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1319453297576382567/1336772551250149446/Rotface_Tank_Kite.webp?ex=67a505f4&is=67a3b474&hm=9bc60e63910ed8f7dc670275ed0f5c64e5b51c28ada9062e526aadc83e90b628&)

If for some reason the Big ooze has been merged with 5x it will begin to cast [Unstable Ooze Explosion](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=69832/unstable-ooze-explosion). When this happens EVERYBODY except the Main Tank needs to run to the wall and wait until it ends. Main tank you will just need to Reposition yourself so the explosion doesnt hit you. Once it is cast it will shoot an ooze bomb at your last location before the cast. Just move from there.

Throughout the encounter Rotface will cast [Slime Spray](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=69508/slime-spray). When he does this he will randomly start spitting in a direction. Melee DPS need to reposition themselves behind the boss and Main tank you need to reposition yourself aswell so you are always in front of the boss.

Rinse and Repeat these mechanics until the boss is dead.
